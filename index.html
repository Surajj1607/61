          <h2>About</h2>
          
      <p>Since the time I was able to read sentences, I had built up a thirst for reading. I just wanted to read more. I wouldn'tveven miss reading advertisements and hoardings. We could not only afford newspapers and they would always be in my hands. I would beg my rich friends to lend me their story books as i could not afford them. I would read them quickly so that I could return them and request for more. As I developed the hobby of reading, I would just peep into a dictionary and learn new words. I enjoyed what was written. I would get transported into a story and live in it. Some books and articles I read made me laugh and some brought tears into my eyes. Actually when I read, I become one with the story and if there are animal characters I feel I am with them. This created world is my private world. I have joined a new library so that I don't have to be without books to read. Books give me company. They are my true friends whom I carry wherever and whenever I want. Most of my pocket money is spent in buying reading material but I have to be careful as some reading material is trash. I would like to say that the habit of reading is far better than just watching TV. Books are ineed our best friends.</p>

      <p>Igor Ivanovich Sikorsky (Russian: И́горь Ива́нович Сико́рский, tr. Ígor' Ivánovič Sikórskij; May 25, 1889 – October 26, 1972) was a Russian–American aviation pioneer in both helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft. His first success came with the S-2, the second aircraft of his design and construction. His fifth airplane, the S-5, won him national recognition as well as F.A.I. license number 64. His S-6-A received the highest award at the 1912 Moscow Aviation Exhibition, and in the fall of that year the aircraft won first prize for its young designer, builder and pilot in the military competition at Saint Petersburg.

After immigrating to the United States in 1919, Sikorsky founded the Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation in 1923, and developed the first of Pan American Airways' ocean-crossing flying boats in the 1930s.

In 1939, Sikorsky designed and flew the Vought-Sikorsky VS-300, the first viable American helicopter, which pioneered the rotor configuration used by most helicopters today. Sikorsky modified the design into the Sikorsky R-4, which became the world's first mass-produced helicopter in 1942.</p>
